ASSIGNMENT 4-

Following feature has been made by me in the project as a part of the group assignment-
1. Searching Content: the feature intends to implement a service search that the user will search while finding a given service.
The Bluenose URL for the feature implementation is as below-
http://bluenose.cs.dal.ca:36095/services 
The overall project is hosted on the following URL-
http://bluenose.cs.dal.ca:36095
The service search implementation has been done keeping in mind the user psychology. 
Here along with the simple string of service, the service description is also searched to find the related words. 
This will automatically redirect the user to the desired service. 
The description has been designed in a way that user will hit and match at least one related word for which user will have the related service.
The search has been implemented on the service page where the admin can add a service and eventually same principle will be used to search a service by the user.
