**1.**  **Assignment 4:**
    
    The following features have been developed as part of the fourth assignment:
        
        1. Checkout Services: This features provide receipt to the customer about the details of his order and the amount that he has paid
        for that order.The receipt is emailed to the user as an attachment.
        
        2. Payments System: This feature allows the users to pay for the services that they have purchased.A user can fill all the mandatory 
        details and pay for the services.
            
        The url for the payments system and checkout services is mentioned below:
        
        http://bluenose.cs.dal.ca:35826/checkout
            
        Since both the services are interlinked.Therefore, these both services cover three features of the application which are: Payment System,
        Receipt Generation and Email System, which were presented during the Project Proposal.To use the payment system, a user must be logged in
        to the application.
            
            
**2.**  **Libraries Used**

        The following libraries have been used to develop the backend of the above mentioned features:
        
        1.  react-stripe-checkout - This library provides the default payment system.It can be used in test mode and the development mode.
            For this application, we are using this in test mode as we need to build a dummy payment system.
            
        2.  receipt - This library provides the layout to create a receipt.This receipt will be used to notify the user about his order details.
        
        3.  nodemailer - This library has been used to create the email server.
        
**3.** **How to use the application**

        1. Download the project from the below mentioned repository:
           https://git.cs.dal.ca/khackett/book-it/tree/Singh_Manpreet_B00821998
           
        2. Run 'npm install' in the root folder of the project.
        
        3. Use command 'npm run dev' to run the application.This will host the application on 'http://localhost:3000'
        
        4. Change port number to '3001; in place of 'process.env.SERVER_PORT' in 'server.js'.Then, use command 'node server.js'
           to connect to the MongoDB.
        
        The project has been hosted at the below mentioned URL with above mentioned features implemented:
        
            http://bluenose.cs.dal.ca:35826
